The Open Forms project was initiated by Maykin Media to create a generic user
facing application to start a "Zaak" in Open Zaak. Using Common Ground 
principles and making this product specifically for municipalities, we hope 
Open Forms will be a powerful addition to the Common Ground product family.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who laid the groundwork, have submitted patches, reported bugs, added
translations, helped answer questions, and generally made Open Forms that much 
better:

    Joeri Bekker <joeri@maykinmedia.nl>
    David Oberholzer <david@maykinmedia.nl>
    Sven van de Scheur <sven@maykinmedia.nl>

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    The Form.io team for making such a great open source library that speed up
    the development of Open Forms.

    All people behind Common Ground for their enthusiasm and vision.
