Email
=====

Open Forms can be configured to register form submissions by email.

Sending the registrations uses the global :ref:`email-settings` and does not 
require additional configuration. The receiving address can be configured when 
building the form.

.. note::
    
    Email should be configured by the Open Forms supplier and also requires
    proper setup of SPF and/or DMARC-records.
