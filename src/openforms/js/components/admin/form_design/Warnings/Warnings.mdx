# Form Warnings

This component collects the components that display warnings in the form designer. It warns the user
about:

- Missing translations: if translations are enabled on the form but not all literals in the form
  have been translated.
- Multiple co-sign components: currently Open Forms supports only one co-sign component per form. If
  there are multiple, any extra component will be ignored.
- Missing authentication plugin: if the co-sign component requires an authentication plugin that is
  not enabled on the form.
- Co-sign component in repeating groups: since only one co-sign component is allowed per form, it
  makes no sense to add them inside a repeating group.

## Warning for missing authentication plugin for co-sign component

This component catches situations in which the co-sign component specifies that the co-signer should
authenticate with a particular authentication plugin, but that plugin is not enabled on the form.
