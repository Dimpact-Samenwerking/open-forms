# NLX support

[NLX][NLX] integration is optional, but available.

This directory contains the docker-compose tooling and instructions on how to enable
NLX on the demo network and connect Open Forms services with it.

## Running the NLX stack

Navigate to this directory and start the components using docker-compose:

```bash
cd nlx
docker-compose up
```


## Updating the NLX stack

The compose file and related files are obtained from the
[upstream documentation](https://docs.nlx.io/try-nlx/docker/introduction).
